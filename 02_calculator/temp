Well if the damned computer didn't crash earlier this might be a lengthier post but work went extremely well, it was one of the bigger trucks we've seen in some time so I'm very proud of the guys for getting it all wrapped up before 10AM. I felt slight irritations here and there but was able to keep it under wraps and have a greatly productive day. I didn't feel that rush of energy that I had last week and have a hunch it may have to do with working out the day before. So tonight I went to the gym and did my cardio and I'm going to make sure to get a great nights sleep and see what energy tomorrow brings, hopefully cocaine energy. I work with Ben tomorrow which always has the possibility to be annoying but I'll give him a chance. I might work consumables with him for a couple of hours and then try to clean up that mess of a steel. Work is going to be long (until 3!) so I'll not be coding tomorrow but who knows maybe I'll at least take a crack at problem 3 since I'm having so much fun with it.. Speaking of the coding, today has probably been the most productive day thus far. I made it through the full two hour blocks I was attempting to do so I'm extremely happy about that. I did waste a good 20 minutes getting frustrated at something even though it was a silly error on my part, at least it was a learning experience I suppose. It's funny looking back to when I started the ruby project I remember feeling oddly anxious and excited and when I saw the first error message my initial response was to panic a bit on the inside. Once I got a little more comfortable it came naturally and I'm already through the first few problems. I guess it just goes to show I have to be patient and more confident in myself. I have a trial membership to tutsplus for 10 days so I think I'll poke around on there a bit more. Their rspec tutorial was incredibly helpful so I can only imagine what else must exist on their website. Well I guess I'd better check out before the computer
